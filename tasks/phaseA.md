### Sales Platform Strategy
- [x] Set up tracking spreadsheet (Item | List Price | Platform | Status | Sale Price | Date | Buyer Contact)

## Success Metrics
- Minimum $500 revenue target (adjust based on inventory)
- 70%+ of listed items sold
- Garage and workspace cleared for Phase B work
- Funds available for mini-split repair and materials

## Notes
- Don't undersell quality items—price fairly but be willing to negotiate
- "Free" listings for junk items can clear space quickly if sale isn't viable
- Consider bundling slow-moving items as project lots
- Time-box this phase: if items don't sell in 3 weeks, donate or dispose to keep momentum
