# 700 Mason — House Sale Master Plan

## Overview

This master plan outlines the phased approach to preparing 700 Mason for sale. The strategy prioritizes converting excess inventory into cash and space, eliminating critical inspection risk items, completing high-impact visual improvements, and preparing for a successful pre-listing inspection.

The work is organized into four sequential phases, each with clear goals and exit criteria. The approach minimizes wasted effort while maximizing buyer confidence and sale price.

---

## Phase A: Convert Excess → Cash & Space

**Goal:** Liquidate unused tools, materials, and equipment to fund renovation work and clear working space.

**Scope:**
- Sell tools not needed for remaining work
- Sell yardwork equipment and materials
- Sell excess wood and building materials
- Sell ducted hood range (to fund recirculating replacement)
- Document all transactions for tax and budgeting purposes

**Why it matters:**
- Generates capital for Phase B and C expenses
- Reduces clutter for staging and showings
- Demonstrates to buyers that the property is well-maintained, not a project house

**Exit criteria:**
- All identified items listed on appropriate platforms (Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist, eBay, etc.)
- Minimum 70% of target items sold
- Funds transferred to renovation budget
- Workspace cleared for Phase B work

**Tasks:** See [tasks/phaseA.md](tasks/phaseA.md)

## Phase B: Kill Inspection Red Flags

**Goal:** Eliminate or document all critical safety, mechanical, and structural issues that would flag during a professional home inspection.

**Scope:**
- Mini-split condenser diagnostics and board replacement
- Electrical panel evaluation and main shutoff work
- Install all missing receptacle covers
- Fix unsafe or non-functional outlets
- Clean up open junction boxes in unfinished basement
- Get quotes and plan for roofing work
- Get quotes and plan for stucco sagging repair
- Patch office closet floor

**Why it matters:**
- Inspection red flags kill deals or reduce offers significantly
- Safety issues create liability concerns for buyers and lenders
- Demonstrating these are resolved builds trust and justifies asking price

**Exit criteria:**
- Mini-split fully operational and documented
- All electrical safety hazards eliminated or professionally quoted
- All junction boxes properly covered
- Roofing and stucco quotes in hand with clear remediation plan
- No obvious code violations remaining

**Tasks:** See [tasks/phaseB.md](tasks/phaseB.md)

## Phase C: Visual Finish + Value Add

**Goal:** Complete high-visibility improvements that enhance buyer perception and justify premium pricing.

**Scope:**
- DIY refinish first floor hardwood floors (drum sand, edge, finish)
- Purchase and install recirculating range hood with custom enclosure
- Address any cosmetic gaps exposed during Phase B work

**Why it matters:**
- Hardwood floors are a major buyer focal point and value driver
- Modern, functional kitchen ventilation is expected in this market
- These improvements pay for themselves in sale price and days on market

**Exit criteria:**
- First floor hardwood refinished with smooth, uniform appearance
- Recirculating hood installed and functional with clean integration
- No exposed "half-finished" work visible to buyers

**Tasks:** See [tasks/phaseC.md](tasks/phaseC.md)

## Phase D: Pre-Inspection Awareness & Minor Cleanup

**Goal:** Self-identify typical inspection callouts for Kennett Square, PA market and make strategic fix-vs-disclose decisions.

**Scope:**
- Review common inspection items for area and property age
- Walk property with inspector mindset
- Address minor cosmetic and functional items
- Prepare disclosure documentation for known issues
- Final staging prep

**Why it matters:**
- Prevents surprises during buyer's inspection
- Allows strategic decisions on what to fix vs. disclose vs. price in
- Demonstrates seller transparency and good faith

**Exit criteria:**
- Self-inspection walkthrough completed and documented
- Decision log created for each identified item
- Minor repairs completed
- Disclosure documents prepared
- Property ready for professional photography and listing

**Tasks:** See [tasks/phaseD.md](tasks/phaseD.md)

## Timeline Philosophy

This plan prioritizes **doing the right work in the right order** over arbitrary deadlines. Each phase builds on the previous one. Rushing Phase B to get to Phase C creates risk. Moving methodically ensures quality and avoids rework.

Target: Complete all phases before listing. Estimated total timeline: 6-10 weeks depending on contractor availability and weather.
