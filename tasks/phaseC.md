# Phase C: Visual Finish + Value Add

## Task Checklist

### First Floor Hardwood Refinishing (DIY)

#### Planning & Prep
- [ ] Measure square footage of first floor hardwood
- [ ] Research drum sander and edger rental options (Home Depot, local tool rental)
- [ ] Create tool rental timeline (typically 24-48 hour rental period)
- [ ] Purchase sandpaper in grits: 36, 60, 80, 100 (drum and edger)
- [ ] Select finish type (oil-based polyurethane vs. water-based)
- [ ] Calculate finish quantity needed (coverage per gallon)
- [ ] Purchase applicators (lambswool applicator, brushes, rollers)
- [ ] Plan ventilation strategy

#### Prep Work
- [ ] Clear all furniture from first floor
- [ ] Remove floor registers and vents
- [ ] Set nails below surface with nail set
- [ ] Inspect for any loose boards or major gaps
- [ ] Decide on filler approach (optional or minimal—gaps are period-appropriate)
- [ ] Tape off baseboards if needed
- [ ] Seal doorways to contain dust

#### Sanding Process
- [ ] Pick up drum sander and edger
- [ ] First pass: 36 grit (drum) — remove old finish
- [ ] Edge first pass: 36 grit
- [ ] Vacuum thoroughly
- [ ] Second pass: 60 grit (drum)
- [ ] Edge second pass: 60 grit
- [ ] Vacuum thoroughly
- [ ] Third pass: 80 grit (drum)
- [ ] Edge third pass: 80 grit
- [ ] Vacuum thoroughly
- [ ] Optional final pass: 100 grit for ultra-smooth finish
- [ ] Hand-sand corners and tight spots
- [ ] Final vacuum and tack cloth wipe

#### Finishing
- [ ] Apply wood conditioner if using (optional, helps even stain absorption)
- [ ] First coat of polyurethane (thin, even application)
- [ ] Allow to dry per manufacturer instructions (typically 4-6 hours)
- [ ] Light sand with 220 grit between coats
- [ ] Vacuum and tack cloth
- [ ] Second coat of polyurethane
- [ ] Allow to dry
- [ ] Light sand with 220 grit
- [ ] Third coat of polyurethane (final)
- [ ] Allow to cure fully (24-48 hours before light traffic, 7 days before furniture)

#### Cleanup & Return
- [ ] Return rental equipment on time
- [ ] Dispose of sandpaper and applicators properly (oil-soaked rags are fire hazard—spread flat to dry)
- [ ] Reinstall floor registers and vents
- [ ] Photograph finished floors

### Recirculating Range Hood & Enclosure

#### Planning
- [ ] Measure space for hood (width, depth, height to cabinet)
- [ ] Research recirculating hood models suitable for range size
- [ ] Confirm no ducting needed (recirculating/ductless)
- [ ] Design custom enclosure plan (materials, dimensions, finish)
- [ ] Sketch enclosure design

#### Purchase
- [ ] Purchase recirculating range hood (budget from ducted hood sale)
- [ ] Purchase materials for custom enclosure:
  - [ ] Wood for structure (plywood, poplar, or matching cabinet wood)
  - [ ] Trim/molding for finished look
  - [ ] Paint or stain to match kitchen
  - [ ] Screws, brackets, hardware
- [ ] Purchase mounting hardware if not included with hood

#### Installation
- [ ] Remove old ducted hood (if not already removed in Phase A)
- [ ] Cap off duct opening if needed (drywall patch or decorative cover)
- [ ] Build custom enclosure frame
- [ ] Mount hood per manufacturer instructions
- [ ] Install enclosure around hood
- [ ] Finish enclosure (paint or stain)
- [ ] Install trim and details
- [ ] Connect electrical (verify circuit is appropriate)
- [ ] Test hood fan and lights
- [ ] Photograph installed hood

## Success Metrics
- Hardwood floors refinished with smooth, uniform appearance
- No visible sanding marks, gouges, or uneven finish
- Recirculating hood fully functional and visually integrated
- Kitchen looks complete and modern
- Both improvements photograph well for listing

## Notes
- Schedule hardwood work when you can vacate for 3-5 days (dust, fumes, cure time)
- Rent professional equipment—DIY sanders won't cut it for full floors
- Practice with drum sander on scrap or garage floor first (easy to gouge)
- Work with the grain, never across it
- Oil-based poly is more durable but longer dry time; water-based is faster but softer
- Recirculating hoods require charcoal filter maintenance—include spare filter for buyer
- Custom enclosure should look intentional, not DIY hack—measure twice, cut once
