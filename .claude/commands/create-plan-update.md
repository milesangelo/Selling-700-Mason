# 🔄 Create Plan Update

Generates an updated plan snippet showing current progress.

---

Read `plan.md`, `status.md`, and all task files in `tasks/` directory.

Generate a concise progress update that includes:

1. **Original Plan Summary**: Brief recap of the overall plan
2. **Progress Made**: What has been completed so far
3. **Current Status**: Where we are now
4. **Next Steps**: What should happen next (2-3 items)
5. **Blockers/Notes**: Any issues or important observations

Format as a clean markdown snippet that could be:
- Posted in a project update
- Committed to status.md
- Shared with stakeholders

Use clear headings, bullet points, and emoji indicators (✅, 🔄, ⬜) for visual clarity.

Keep it concise but informative - aim for a 1-minute read.
